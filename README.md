PuTTY Patched
=============

This is a mirror of Simon's git repository ~~with my TrueColor patch
in the truecolor branch~~ (has been deleted, as the true color patch has been merged [upstream](https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git;a=commit;h=a4cbd3dfdb71d258e83bbf5b03a874c06d0b3106)

The [master branch](https://github.com/chrisbra/putty/tree/master) of this
repository is a clone of the master from Simon's PuTTY repo at
[git://git.tartarus.org/simon/putty.git](https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/putty.git)
